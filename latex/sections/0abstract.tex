\small\bf Abstract---
Bypass diodes are added to photovoltaic (PV) modules to compensate for power loss under shading effects. However, existing models cannot efficiently model PV modules with bypass diodes. In this paper, we develop an efficient Colony-Wise model with the nearly the same accuracy as the Ground Truth (GT) model, but its calculating time is reduced by $5.81$ times on average. Furthermore, a more efficient N-Colony model is proposed, which has an average $5.15\%$ maximum power point error, and an average power-voltage curve correlation of $0.96$, and uses about $1/16$ calculating time when compared to the GT model. To the best of our knowledge, the Colony-Wise model and the N-Colony model are the two most efficient models for real-time solar energy prediction.
