\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, two new PV module models are proposed, namely the Colony-Wise (CW) model and the N-Colony (NC) model. The two new models can support multiple shading levels on a PV module and various PV module configurations. The Colony-Wise model can efficiently capture the P-V curve of a PV module with almost no accuracy loss. The N-Colony model can further reduce the model¡¯s computational complexity with a limited accuracy loss.

The N-Colony model is based on curve fitting. The accuracy of the model is highly related to the curve fitting process. Our future work will be finding optimal/good parameters in a high-dimensional solution space.
